# Intro

The Cashu Development Kit (CDK) is a Rust toolkit for the development of Cashu wallets and mints.

## For wallet developers

It implements the Cashu protocol and exposes its operations through a simple interface, making it easy for app developers to integrate a Cashu wallet with just a few lines of code.

To get started, go to the [CDK Wallet Intro](wallet/00_intro.md)

## For mint operators

CDK provides a full mint implementation, with guides on how to configure, run and maintain it.
