# Optional Operations

This section covers the optional wallet operations. These are based on the optional parts of [the protocol spec](https://cashubtc.github.io/nu), more specifically from NUT-07 upwards.

These specs are supported by the CDK, but it's up to the app developers whether these are integrated into the app.
